# lonkbalance - New Weapons Branch

This branch adds some newish weapons and makes more major changes to vanilla weapons. Use this branch if you want to live on the edge.

## Orig. README

Vanilla TTT has some balance issues. The Shotgun is pretty good at medium ranges for some reason, and some T-weapons aren't that useful.

This mod tries to fix that.
